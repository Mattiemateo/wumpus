# Hunt the Wumpus

Hunt the Wumpus is a classic text-based adventure game where players navigate through a cave system to hunt the legendary Wumpus while avoiding hazards. This repository contains two implementations of the game: one in Bash and another in Python.

## Game Description

In Hunt the Wumpus, you find yourself in a cave with 10 interconnected rooms. Your goal is to hunt down and kill the Wumpus using your arrows before it eats you or you fall into a pit. The cave also contains super bats that can carry you to a random room.

The game provides cryptic hints to help you deduce the location of the Wumpus and other dangers in the cave, like bottomless pits and super bats. Using logic and some luck, you'll need to navigate the maze and use your limited number of arrows strategically to survive and win.
